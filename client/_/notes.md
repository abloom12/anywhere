# Thoughts on mobile table design

- could make each row a card? this is my least favorite

- hybrid accordion table layout. as we run out of space the column leaves table and goes inside table row.
- most tables on small screens would have 2-3 columns of data in row then rest would live in accordion body.

- could truncate the text on some columns
- word wrapping
- hide less important columns
