To handle dynamic segments like "foo/bar/:id", we need a way to distinguish between static and dynamic parts of a route. Here's a general approach to think through:

1. Identify Dynamic Segments

   A dynamic segment in a URL is typically denoted by a colon (:) followed by an identifier, like :id.
   In our case, foo/bar/:id would mean that foo and bar are static segments, while :id is dynamic.

2. Handling Dynamic Segments in the Trie

   Dynamic Segments: Instead of storing :id as a literal string, we should flag it as a placeholder that can match any value. The Trie would need to treat this segment differently.
   We could introduce a special handling in the TrieNode class to manage dynamic children. Instead of just mapping a segment to a node, we could create a dedicated branch for dynamic segments.

3. Route Matching Strategy

   When resolving routes, if a dynamic segment is encountered (e.g., :id), it would match any path segment, but we would need to keep track of the dynamic value (e.g., what :id is).
   During lookup, if a static segment doesn’t match, we can fall back to checking if there is a dynamic child available.
   For example, when matching /foo/bar/123, if foo and bar match statically, then 123 would match the dynamic :id.

4. Storing Dynamic Parameters

   During the route matching process, dynamic parameters should be extracted and stored in a dictionary or map. For example, when matching /foo/bar/123 against foo/bar/:id, we would store id: 123.

5. TrieNode Modifications

   We could add an additional dynamicChild property to store dynamic segments separately from static segments.
   When adding a dynamic segment, like :id, we would store it as a "wildcard" child in the node, but it would be treated specially during matching and route resolution.

6. Route Resolution Process

   When resolving a route, we would iterate through each segment in the path.
   For each segment:
   Check for a static match: See if there is a direct match in the current TrieNode’s children.
   Check for a dynamic match: If no static match is found, check if there is a dynamicChild.
   If we encounter a dynamic segment during matching, we would capture the actual value of the segment in the path (like capturing 123 for :id).

Example of Path Flow:

    For the route "foo/bar/:id/posts/:postid", the static segments would go into the Trie as they are, while the dynamic segments would be stored as a "wildcard" path in the dynamicChild.
    When resolving a path like "foo/bar/123/posts/456", the static segments foo and bar would be directly matched, and then 123 would be stored as the value for id from the dynamic segment :id, and similarly, 456 for :postid.
